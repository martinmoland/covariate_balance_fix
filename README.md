# About this repository

Sometimes journal submissions require you to submit plots in black-and-white, rather than color. I found no easy way to do this using the get_covariate_balance function from the brilliant [PanelMatch](https://github.com/insongkim/PanelMatch) package. 

This little code snippet can be with the native R function *trace* to create plots where the covariate balance between treatment and control units for each of the variables that you have tried to create balance on are represented by variations in linetype rather than color. This applies to both the plot and legend.

If you see ways of improving this code and making it more useful, possibly by allowing for more customizable plots, please let me know. I can be reached at [martin.moland@arena.uio.no](mailto:martin.moland@arena.uio.no).
